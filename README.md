# Course Conflict Flagger

## Overview

The Course Conflict Flagger is a Python-based application designed to help students and academic advisors at Berry College identify and manage course conflicts. This tool utilizes data gathered from a comprehensive school-wide survey to minimize course conflicts in Berry College's School of Mathematics and Natural Science (MNS).

## Key Features

- **Survey Data Analysis**: Conducted a comprehensive school-wide survey to gather data on course enrollments. The survey identifies which courses are frequently taken simultaneously in the same semester, generating course conflict groups.

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Developed an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) in Python that enables users to easily identify conflicts in Berry Collegeâ€™s MNS course list. The application leverages predefined course conflict groups, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

- **Schedule Remodeling Suggestions**: The program is being extended to provide actionable suggestions for remodeling course schedules. By minimizing conflicts, the tool aims to enhance the overall academic experience for students at Berry College.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `flask` for GUI development
  - `pandas` and `openpyxl` for Microsoft Excel data manipulation
